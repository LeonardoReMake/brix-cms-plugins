/**
 * If your node implements this interface, it can indicate whether it allows a
 * certain node type as a child. This will be used when creating a new node in
 * the hierarchical manager panel.
 * 
 * For instance, say that you have a tree that needs to be structured like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * - news root node
 *   - news article
 *     - article section
 *       - article content
 *       - article content
 *     - article section
 *       - article content
 *       - article content
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If someone is currently editing an article section and clicks
 * "create new article", you don't want it to be a child of the article section.
 * You want it to be a child of the root node. So, if your section, article, and
 * root nodes all implement this interface, the section and article nodes can
 * return false. The root node would return true (or not implement the
 * interface, meaning that it accepts anything). Then, no matter where you were
 * in that tree when you created a new article, it would end up being a child of
 * the root. Or, if you created a section, it would end up, not as a child of
 * the section you were previously editing, but as a child of the article.
